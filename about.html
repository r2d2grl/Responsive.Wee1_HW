        Letter -from Father Theodore written from Kharkov Station to his wife in
        the district centre of N. 
        </br>
        </br>
        My Darling Catherine Alexandrovna, I owe you
        an apology. I have left you alone, poor thing, at a time like this. I
        must tell you everything. You will understand and, I hope, agree. It was
        not, of course, to join the new church movement that I went. I had no
        intention of doing so, God forbid! 
        </br>
        </br>
        Now read this carefully. I'm on to
        something, but you must keep it absolutely secret: don't even tell Marya
        Ivanovna. I'm looking for treasure. That's why I left so suddenly, you
        poor thing. Don't condemn me.
        </br>       
        </br>       
        I'm now sitting in the station at Kharkov
        and writing for this reason: first, I love you very much and keep
        thinking of you, and, second, Bruns is no longer here. But don't
        despair. Bruns is now working in Rostov at the New-Ros-Cement plant. I
        have just enough money for the fare. I'm leaving in an hour's time on a
        mixed passenger-goods train. Please stop by your brother-in-law's, my
        sweet, and get fifty roubles from him (he owes it to me and promised to
        pay) and send it to: Theodore Ivanovich Vostrikov, Central Post Office,
        Rostov, to await collection. Send a money order by post to economize. It
        will cost thirty kopeks.
        </br>       
        </br>       
        What's the news in the town? Has Kondratyevna been to see you? Tell Father Cyril that I'll be back soon and that I've
        gone to see my dying aunt in Voronezh. Be economical. Is Evstigneyev
        still having meals? Give him my regards. Say I've gone to my aunt. How's
        the weather? It's already summer here in Kharkov. A noisy city, the
        centre of the Ukrainian Republic. After the provinces it's like being
        abroad. 
        </br>       
        </br>       
        Please do the following: (1) Send my summer cassock to the
        cleaner (it's better to spend Rs. 3 on cleaning than waste money on
        buying a new one); (2) look after yourself; and (3) when you write to
        Gulka, mention casually that I've gone to Voronezh to see my aunt. Give
        everyone my regards. Say I'll be back soon. With tender kisses and
        blessings, Your husband, Theo.

        CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO ELLOCHKA THE CANNIBAL
        </br>
        </br> 
        William Shakespeare's vocabulary has been estimated by the experts at twelve thousand words.
        The vocabulary of a Negro from the Mumbo Jumbo tribe amounts to three
        hundred words. Ellochka Shukin managed easily and fluently on thirty.
        Here are the words, phrases and interjections which she fastidiously
        picked from the great, rich and expressive Russian language: 
        </br>
        </br>
        1. You're
        being vulgar. 2. Ho-ho (expresses irony, surprise, delight, loathing,
        joy, contempt and satisfaction, according to the circumstances). 3.
        Great! 4. Dismal (applied to everything-for example: "dismal Pete has
        arrived", "dismal weather", or a "dismal cat"). 5. Gloom. 6. Ghastly
        (for example: when meeting a close female acquaintance, "a ghastly
        meeting"). 7. Kid (applied to all male acquaintances, regardless of age
        or social position). 8. Don't tell me how to live! 9. Like a babe ("I
        whacked him like a babe" when playing cards, or "I brought him down like
        a babe," evidently when talking to a legal tenant). 10. Ter-r-rific! 11.
        Fat and good-looking (used to describe both animate and inanimate
        objects). 12. Let's go by horse-cab (said to her husband). 13. Let's go
        by taxi (said to male acquaintances). 14. You're all white at the back!
        (joke). 15. Just imagine! 16. Ula (added to a name to denote
        affection-for example: Mishula, Zinula). 17. Oho! (irony, surprise,
        delight, loathing, joy, contempt and satisfaction). 
        </br>
        </br>
        The extraordinary small number of words remaining were used as connecting links between
        Ellochka and department-store assistants. 
        </br>
        </br>
        If you looked at the
        photographs of Ellochka Shukin which her husband, engineer Ernest
        Pavlovich Shukin, had hanging over his bed (one profile and the other
        full-face), you would easily see her pleasantly high and curved
        forehead, big liquid eyes, the cutest little nose in the whole of the
        province of Moscow, and a chin with a small beauty spot. Men found
        Ellochka's height nattering. She was petite, and even the puniest little
        men looked hefty he-men beside her. She had no particular distinguishing
        features; she did not need them. She was pretty. 
        </br>
        </br>
        The two hundred roubles
        which her husband earned each month at the Electrolustre works was an
        insult to Ellochka.
