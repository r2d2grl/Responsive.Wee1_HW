      <p>
        Letter -from Father Theodore written from Kharkov Station to his wife in
        the district centre of N. My Darling Catherine Alexandrovna, I owe you
        an apology. I have left you alone, poor thing, at a time like this. I
        must tell you everything. You will understand and, I hope, agree. ....
        I'm now sitting in the station at Kharkov and writing for this reason:
        first, I love you very much and keep thinking of you, and, second, Bruns
        is no longer here. But don't despair. Bruns is now working in Rostov at
        the New-Ros-Cement plant. I have just enough money for the fare. I'm
        leaving in an hour's time on a mixed passenger-goods train. Please stop
        by your brother-in-law's, my sweet, and get fifty roubles from him (he
        owes it to me and promised to pay) and send it to: Theodore Ivanovich
        Vostrikov, Central Post Office, Rostov, to await collection. Send a
        money order by post to economize. It will cost thirty kopeks. What's the
        news in the town? Has Kondratyevna been to see you? Tell Father Cyril
        that I'll be back soon and that I've gone to see my dying aunt in
        Voronezh. Be economical. Is Evstigneyev still having meals? Give him my
        regards. Say I've gone to my aunt. How's the weather?
      </p>
      <p>
        It's already summer here in Kharkov. A noisy city, the centre of the
        Ukrainian Republic. After the provinces it's like being abroad. Please
        do the following: (1) Send my summer cassock to the cleaner (it's better
        to spend Rs. 3 on cleaning than waste money on buying a new one); (2)
        look after yourself; and (3) when you write to Gulka, mention casually
        that I've gone to Voronezh to see my aunt. Give everyone my regards. Say
        I'll be back soon. With tender kisses and blessings, Your husband, Theo.
      </p>
